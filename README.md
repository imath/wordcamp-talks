# WordCamp Talk Proposals

WordCamp organizers can save some precious time when managing their **call for speakers**. The WordCamp Talk Proposals plugin is their tool to manage the talk proposals of their potential speakers. Speakers simply need to have a WordPress.org profile to submit their proposals.

## Speakers are saving time!

When the plugin is activated on a WordCamp.org site, they can simply log in using their WordPress.org credentials to start submitting their talk. They can customize their biographical information for this particular WordCamp from their front-end profile. Their edits will be saved into a Pending WordCamp Speaker Post Type.

When the plugin is activated on any website, they'll need to register using their WordPress.org account username and their Gravatar email. Once registered, their WordPress.org biographical information and display name will automagically be used in the website.

When used on a WordCamp.org site, they can save more time once they selected their talks by using the **Draft a Session** button to init a session. This button will only show if candidates have saved their biographical information from their front-end profile.
